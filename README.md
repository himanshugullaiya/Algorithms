# Algorithms

Here are some of the most Popular Algorithms in  C++ and Python:
1) Sorting

    -> Merge Sort
    
    -> Quick Sort 
    
2) Dynamic Programming

    -> Length of LCS (Recursion)
    
    -> Print LCS (tabulation Method)
    
    -> Pattern Matching: KMP
 
3) Graphs
    -> BFS , DFS
    
    -> Minimum Spanning Tree
        
        * PRIMS, KRUSKALS *
    
    -> Single Source Shortest Path
        
        * DIJKSTRA, BELLMAN - FORD *
     
    -> Floyd - Warshall Algorithm
